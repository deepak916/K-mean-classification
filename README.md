# K-mean-classification
This contains a GUI matlab file, which takes input as a image/imagery file and perform the k-mean classification.
K-mean algorithm is a unsupervised classification.
Extraction   of   features   is   the   most   significant   step   of   any recognition system. 
The aim of feature extraction is to consider
The  vital  characteristics  of  the  image  to  classify  the  overall image  by  mean  of  this  small  set  of  info:  
The  selection  of features    straight    and    simply    effects    the    operation    of classification. 
Good features ultimately result  ina high success rate  in the flow of  recognition and vice  versa.
